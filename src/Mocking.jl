    Mocking.nullify()

Force any packages loaded after this point to treat the `@mock` macro as a no-op. Doing so
will maximize performance by eliminating any runtime checks taking place at the `@mock` call
sites but will break any tests that require patches to be applied.

Note to ensure that all `@mock` macros are inoperative be sure to call this function before
loading any packages which depend on Mocking.jl.

Enable `@mock` call sites to allow for calling patches instead of the original function.
